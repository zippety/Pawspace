# PawSpace Safety System

## Overview

The Safety System is a critical component that ensures the well-being of all pets and humans within PawSpace environments. It combines real-time monitoring, risk assessment, and emergency response protocols.

## Core Components

### 1. Risk Assessment Engine

#### Features
- Real-time environment monitoring
- Behavioral analysis
- Space safety scoring
- Capacity management

#### Risk Factors
```typescript
interface RiskFactors {
  environmental: {
    temperature: number;
    humidity: number;
    noise: number;
    lighting: number;
  };
  behavioral: {
    aggressionLevel: number;
    stressLevel: number;
    activityLevel: number;
  };
  spatial: {
    occupancy: number;
    density: number;
    accessibility: number;
  };
}
```

### 2. Emergency Protocol System

#### Protocols
1. Medical Emergencies
   - Immediate response procedures
   - Vet contact system
   - Transport arrangements
   - Owner notification

2. Environmental Emergencies
   - Weather-related procedures
   - Facility issues response
   - Evacuation protocols
   - Safe zones

3. Behavioral Incidents
   - De-escalation procedures
   - Separation protocols
   - Staff response guidelines
   - Incident reporting

### 3. Incident Management

#### Incident Types
```typescript
interface Incident {
  type: 'medical' | 'behavioral' | 'environmental';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  timestamp: Date;
  location: Location;
  involvedPets: Pet[];
  description: string;
  immediateActions: string[];
  followUpRequired: boolean;
}
```

#### Response System
- Immediate notification
- Staff coordination
- Resource allocation
- Documentation

### 4. Safety Compliance

#### Requirements
1. Facility Requirements
   - Space requirements
   - Safety equipment
   - Emergency exits
   - First aid stations

2. Staff Requirements
   - Certification requirements
   - Training programs
   - Emergency response training
   - Regular assessments

3. Documentation Requirements
   - Incident reports
   - Safety inspections
   - Training records
   - Maintenance logs

## Integration

### 1. Monitoring Integration
```typescript
interface SafetyMonitor {
  realTime: {
    temperature: number;
    humidity: number;
    occupancy: number;
    noiseLevel: number;
  };
  alerts: Alert[];
  status: 'normal' | 'warning' | 'critical';
}
```

### 2. Alert System
```typescript
interface SafetyAlert {
  type: 'environmental' | 'behavioral' | 'medical';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  location: Location;
  message: string;
  requiredAction: string[];
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Prevention
- Regular safety audits
- Proactive maintenance
- Staff training
- Risk assessment

### 2. Response
- Clear communication
- Quick action
- Proper documentation
- Follow-up procedures

### 3. Improvement
- Incident analysis
- Protocol updates
- Staff feedback
- System enhancement

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```env
SAFETY_CHECK_INTERVAL=300000
TEMPERATURE_MAX=85
TEMPERATURE_MIN=65
HUMIDITY_MAX=70
OCCUPANCY_BUFFER=0.9
```

### Alert Thresholds
```typescript
const safetyThresholds = {
  temperature: {
    min: 65,
    max: 85
  },
  humidity: {
    min: 30,
    max: 70
  },
  noise: {
    max: 85 // decibels
  },
  occupancy: {
    max: 0.9 // 90% of capacity
  }
};
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Safety Check
```typescript
const safetyCheck = await safety.checkEnvironment(spaceId);
if (!safetyCheck.safe) {
  await safety.triggerAlert({
    type: 'environmental',
    severity: safetyCheck.severity,
    message: safetyCheck.reason
  });
}
```

### 2. Incident Reporting
```typescript
const incident = await safety.reportIncident({
  type: 'behavioral',
  severity: 'medium',
  description: 'Minor conflict between dogs, resolved with separation',
  location: spaceLocation,
  involvedPets: [pet1, pet2]
});
```

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Medical Emergency
1. Assess situation
2. Contact emergency vet
3. Notify owner
4. Document incident
5. Follow up

### 2. Environmental Emergency
1. Evacuate if necessary
2. Secure facility
3. Contact maintenance
4. Monitor conditions
5. Resume operations

### 3. Behavioral Incident
